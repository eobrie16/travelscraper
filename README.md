# travelscraper
The idea for this little utility is to save me time in doing my travel searches. 
Instead of having to search many sites, I would like to be able to combine, filter, and search all in one place.

First step is to create a scraper to crawl a few of the more popular travel websites to get pricing data. 
Then we can take that data, and put it into a Pandas DataFrame for searching and filtering of pricing and review data.

Eventually, would like to wrap this into a Django website.
